# Statistical-Learning-Lab3
This lab start by Implement by hand a Kernel Regression a non parametric regression </br>
Also Implement by hand 5 cross-validation </br>
Compute diffrent Error Measures : </br>
1.EOP= Expected optimism of regression function.</br>
2.EPEIN= In-sample expected error of  regression function</br>
3.EPE=out-of-sample expected prediction error of regression function.</br>
In addition  in the lba we extract estimate the rate of change in Covid-19 </br>
by using the first-derivative of the regression curve.</br>
Finally fit prediction models for the response voxels (Y) in V1 in response to natural images (X). </br>
